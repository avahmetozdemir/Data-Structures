# Data-Structures

## Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). 

This strategy states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first. 

Some of its main operations are: push(), pop(), top(), isEmpty(), size(), etc.  

In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us. When we want to insert an element into the stack the operation is known as the push operation whereas when we want to remove an element from the stack the operation is known as the pop operation. If we try to pop from an empty stack then it is known as underflow and if we try to push an element in a stack that is already full, then it is known as overflow.
